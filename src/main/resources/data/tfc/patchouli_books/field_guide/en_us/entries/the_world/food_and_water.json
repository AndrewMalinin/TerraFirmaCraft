Most pieces of food restore about a fifth of your hunger bar. Some pieces of food may restore a bit less, such as $(thing)Cattail Roots$(). Eating food also restores $(thing)Saturation$(), which can be thought of as how full you are. Some foods are very filling, so they keep you from losing hunger for longer, while some foods have a short-lived effect."
