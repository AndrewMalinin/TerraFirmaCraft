These can be found on different varieties of bushes or trees. In general, fruits can be found in three types of plants: $(l:the_world/wild_fruits#fruit_trees)Fruit Trees$(), $(l:the_world/wild_fruits#tall_bushes)Tall Bushes$()Tall Bushes$(), and $(l:the_world/wild_fruits#small_bushes)Small Bushes$().$(br2)All fruiting plants have a common lifecycle.
