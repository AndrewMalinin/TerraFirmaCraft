During the early game, while copper is a useful metal for creating tools, the next tier of metal is one of three types of $(thing)Bronze$(). An alloy is made up of component $(thing)metals$(), which must each satisfy a specific percentage of the overall whole."

The process is very similar to $(l:getting_started/finding_ores#casting)Casting$(). However, instead of using just a single metal, inside the vessel, place enough ore pieces, in the correct ratio, to form a known alloy mix."

Each type of bronze can be used to make tools, armor, and other metal items, although each metal is slightly different, and tools will have different durability, efficiency, or attack damage."
