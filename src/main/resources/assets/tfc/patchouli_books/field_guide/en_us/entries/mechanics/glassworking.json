The purest batch is $(thing)Silica$(), made from white sand. The next purest is $(thing)Hematitic$(), made from yellow, red, or pink sand. Then there is $(thing)Olivine$(), made from green or brown sand. Finally, the worst glass batch is $(thing)Volcanic$(), made from black sand."

This can be done just by crafting the blowpipe with the powder, or by using the blowpipe on a $(l:mechanics/powder_bowl)Powder Bowl$(). Since glassworking is chemistry-based, the powders do not work like dyes. For example, any iron powder (Hematite, Limonite, Magnetite) can be used for the 'Iron Powder' operation."
