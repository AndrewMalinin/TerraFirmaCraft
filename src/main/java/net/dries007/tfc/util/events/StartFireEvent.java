/**
 * This event is used for lighting fires or optionally light-able blocks. If it's not cancelled, TFC will try to place a fire block.
 *
 * For things like flint and steel that don't require special mechanics, this event logic is handled for you in
 * {@link InteractionManager#registerDefaultInteractions()}. Adding items to the tag #starts_fires_with_items or #starts_fires_with_durability
 * will emulate this behavior (and allow TFC devices to be lit by your item)
 *
 * Note that the parameters of this event are the same as those expected by an item use, ie that the position, state, and direction
 * reflect what would happen if a block was clicked on. Direction refers to the face that was clicked.
