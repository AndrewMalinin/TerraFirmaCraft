This update finally brings Armor Trims to TFC! Enjoy!

### Changes
- Added the sewing table, a new functional block with its own simple minigame!
  - The sewing table can produce banner patterns as well as smithing templates.
  - To sew a pattern, you need wool cloth, burlap cloth, as well as string. You then must assemble these elements in a given shape using a bone sewing needle to craft the item.
  - Vanilla's loom and smithing table can be used to apply armor trims.
  - In TFC, all gems, along with Sterling Silver, Gold, Rose Gold, and Bismuth, can be used as trim materials. Vanilla materials will not work.
- Added smooth mud bricks
- Added a sound that plays when pit kilns finish
- Hitting a sealed barrel with a stick now plays a bass drum sound.
- You can now destroy icicles by shooting them with a projectile, or by hitting them with a hammer.
- The model shape of icicles and calcite is now simpler.
- The lengths of icicles are now randomized.
- Sea ice will now break when fallen on.
- Breaking snow layers in creative now destroys the entire snow layer block.
- Set some tfc mobs to walk on powder snow and not freeze when inside it.

### Fixes
- Added some missing vanilla item tags related to tools as well as some entity tags
- Fixed squids not being summonable through normal means
- Fixed a bug where the Octopeteuthis would slow down the game (behold it's great power!)
- Fixed powderkeg explosions not damaging the igniter
- Fix anvils not using the 'anvil' sound type.
- Fixed snow and ice forming on water wheels
- Fixed the missing frog loot table. Enjoy your frog legs!
