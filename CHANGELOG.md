### Changes

- Allow (Lex) Forge versions of **47.2.6+** after some testing. **We still recommend 47.1.3 as that is what we are building against and what most mods and both loaders are compatible with.**
- Ivy is no longer climbable, as it is now a creeping plant rather than a vine.
- Added more randomly selected models for placed sticks
- Fallen leaves from conifer trees will now always be brown
- Allow ocean plants to generate in salt marshes.

### Fixes

- Fix some TFC fluids being invisible
- Fix knapping mossy rocks showing a missing texture.
- Fix javelin throwing damage being small or zero. Updated the tooltip.
- Fixed some cases where a full block of fallen leaves wouldn't immediately turn into a leaf block.
